### _Crisp-DM: Towards a Standard Process Model for Data Mining_
Crisp-DM stands for CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. The goal of the project was to specify a process which can be reliably and efficiently repeated by differen people and adapted to different situations. This could help people with lower technical skills and little time to experiment with different approaches. 

#### Introduction
Data mining needs a standard approach to lower the dependency of succes or failure of DM project on the particular person or team that is carrying it out. The paper argues that a standard process model is benificial for the data mining industry and presents some practical experiences with the methodology.

#### Why the DM Industry needs a Standard Process Model
- To overcome the belief that data mining is a push-button technology.
* The model can serve as a common reference point to discuss data mining and will increase the understanding of crucial data mining by all participants
* To create the belief that data mining is an established engineering practice.

#### The Crisp-DM Methodology

##### Overview

##### The Generic Crisp-DM Reference Model
Life cycle of a data mining project:
1. Business Understanding
